## Advices ##


### Random guy in quora ###
- Make Computer Science fundamentals very strong , mainly DataStructure & Algorithm.
-Habit of solving atleast 3-4 code snippets/Week , check Leetcode/CareerCup
-Heard any new technology, like BigData or Machine Learning. Make sure to understand that and implement a POC. Don't just read, make sure, you are very much aware of fundamentals. Like you must know the architecture, go through the case studies and BUILD SOMETHING.
- You gotta market yourself. If you are learning from open Source, its your responsibility, to give back something. Make your github account and contribute. This will make your profile very shiny.
- Attend Hackathons and Technical Meetup. Even you don't know anything, doesn't matter. You must build contacts. the more people you know, the probability to end up with better jobs will be more higher.
- If you don't like your job or Manager don't react, keep smiling and keep working and look for new job. Never destroy your relationship with people.
- Read .. Read ... Read ... CODE IT
