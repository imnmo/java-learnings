--Make Computer Science fundamentals very strong , mainly DataStructure & Algorithm.
Make a habit of solving atleast 3-4 code snippets/Week , check Leetcode/CareerCup
No point of being a master of single technology like Java or Python. Learn several technologies.
I was a java developer for 5 years and then I found functional languages like clojure/Python/Scala and believe me, its worth your time. It will broaden your skill-sets & thinking. And now you are already ahead in the race of Developers and Interviews.
Heard any new technology, like BigData or Machine Learning. Make sure to understand that and implement a POC. Don't just read, make sure, you are very much aware of fundamentals. Like you must know the architecture, go through the case studies and BUILD SOMETHING.
You gotta market yourself. If you are learning from open Source, its your responsibility, to give back something. Make your github account and contribute. This will make your profile very shiny.
Don't fall in love with any single technology. I saw Desktop based application lost its place and now Mobile is rocking, and I wont be amaze if Virtual Reality takes its place or something. So stop falling in love with any technology. Learn whatever is good in market. Yeah it will be huge but your habit will make you proficient to learn anything new and You will be truly a Quick learner.
Attend Hackathons and Technical Meetup. Even you don't know anything, doesn't matter. You must build contacts. the more people you know, the probability to end up with better jobs will be more higher.
If you don't like your job or Manager don't react, keep smiling and keep working and look for new job. Never destroy your relationship with people.
